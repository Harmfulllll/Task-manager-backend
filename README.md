# Task-manager-backend
Task Manager is a backend application built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can register, log in, create tasks, update task details, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and perform various other operations related to task management.


## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login functionality with password hashing for enhanced security.
- **Task Management:** CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks, allowing users to create, view, update, and delete their tasks.
- **Task Filtering and Sorting:** Options for users to filter and sort their tasks based on different criteria, such as completion status, due date, or priority.
- **Pagination:** Efficient pagination for handling large numbers of tasks, improving performance and user experience.
- **User Profile Management:** Allow users to view and update their profile information, including username, email, and password.
- **Token-based Authentication:** JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication to authenticate users and grant access to protected routes.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms to handle various types of errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to users.
- **Authorization:** Middleware to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain routes and that users can only manipulate their own tasks.
- **RESTful API:** Well-defined RESTful API endpoints for seamless interaction with the backend.
